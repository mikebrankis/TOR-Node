Setting up a Tor node requires careful configuration to ensure security and compliance with Tor policies. Below is a step-by-step guide to setting up a Tor relay or exit node on a Linux-based system.

1. Update System

Before installing any software, ensure your system is up-to-date:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install Tor

Add the Tor Project repository to get the latest stable version:

sudo apt install -y tor tor-arm

3. Configure Tor as a Relay or Exit Node

Edit the Tor configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

Modify or add the following settings:

For a Relay Node:

RunAsDaemon 1
ORPort 9001
ExitRelay 0
Nickname MyRelayNode
ContactInfo your-email@example.com
RelayBandwidthRate 1MB
RelayBandwidthBurst 2MB

For an Exit Node (Be cautious, as this can have legal implications):

RunAsDaemon 1
ORPort 9001
ExitRelay 1
ExitPolicy accept *:80, accept *:443, accept *:22
Nickname MyExitNode
ContactInfo your-email@example.com

ExitPolicy defines which traffic is allowed.


4. Restart Tor

Apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart tor

5. Check Node Status

Run:

sudo journalctl -u tor -f

or visit https://metrics.torproject.org/ to see if your node is listed.

6. Monitoring the Node

Use nyx, a terminal-based monitoring tool:

nyx

Security and Considerations

Relay Node: Generally safe, as it only passes encrypted Tor traffic.

Exit Node: High risk! Exit nodes expose your IP to any outgoing traffic, including potentially illegal activity.

Bandwidth Usage: Tor nodes consume a lot of bandwidth, ensure your ISP allows this.
